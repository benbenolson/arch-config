/*
 * Welcome to yed!
 * This file is meant to guide you through the process of using yed and
 * creating/managing your own yed configuration.
 *
 * If you need to quit, press ctrl-p, type "quit", and hit ENTER.
 *
 * Right now, you are using yed without any configuration or plugins.
 * To navigate and edit this file in yed's basic state, use the
 * following keybindings:
 *     Move the cursor:                               arrow keys
 *     Insert a character:                            type the key
 *     Delete the previous character:                 hit the backspace key
 *     Delete the next character:                     hit the delete key
 *     Delete the current line:                       ctrl-d
 *     Select/deselect text:                          ctrl-s
 *     Yank selected text:                            ctrl-c
 *     Paste from yank buffer:                        ctrl-v
 *     Undo:                                          ctrl-u
 *     Redo:                                          ctrl-r
 *     Search for and jump to a string in the buffer: ctrl-f
 *     Write the buffer to disk:                      ctrl-w
 *     Run a command:                                 ctrl-p
 *     Quit:                                          run the command 'quit'

/*
 * Let's get familiar with running a command in yed.
 * To access the command prompt, use the default keybinding ctrl-p.
 * A colon (:) should appear at the bottom of the screen (the command line).
 *
 * Try typing "style" into the command prompt and hit ENTER.
 *
 * "style" is a command that reports the active style when given no
 * arguments, or activates a style when givin the name of one as an
 * argument. You're likely using the style "default".
 *
 * An important command that we're going to use a lot soon is "reload".
 * "reload" allows any configuration from plugins to be reloaded on the fly
 * and for the changes to be made available immediately.
 * There is no need to restart yed when changing your configuration.
 *
 * Run the command "reload".
 * Nothing has changed.
 * Run the command "plugins-list" -- the only output should be "init".
 * That's this file!
 * At this point, this is the only source of configuration for yed.
